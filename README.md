# Merge-Sort

A creation and test case for the Merge Sort algorithm. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts a list by recursively splitting it into two halves until each sublist has one element, then merging those sublists back together in a sorted order. This merge process ensures that the final list is completely ordered, and the algorithm generally operates with a time complexity of O(n log n).
